# SAAB_B207_IMMO-CIM_OFF

Files needed for preparing the SAAB B207L engine for a swap. The map: "FA5L_C_FMEP_78_FIEF_81i (immo off v2).bin" by "Myrtilos from trionictuning.com" 
allows starting the car with the ignition switch and CIM module unplugged, by permanently blocking in the ECU the event of the key being in the "on" position. 

The engine can only be started by manually controlling the starter motor, after applying +12V to the fuel pump relay and ECU. 
Turning off the engine is done by cutting power to the fuel pump relay and ECU.
